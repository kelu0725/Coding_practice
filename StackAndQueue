简单题，能够想到不够优化的做法。优化后，操作更为简洁。
拓展：
Queue用Linkedlist实现：

1. Principle of reusable object-oriented design.
https://www.artima.com/lejava/articles/designprinciples.html
Program to an interface, not an implementation.
Decoupled from implementation.That means the implementation can vary, and that's a healthy dependency relationship.
So this approach gives you flexibility, but it also separates the really valuable part, the design, 
from the implementation, which allows clients to be decoupled from the implementation. 

2. Java Collection
Set ->EnumSet 
    ->SortedSet -> TreeSet
    ->HashSet -> LinkedHashSet
List -> ArrayList
     -> LinkedList
     -> Vector -> Stack
Queue -> Dequeue -> LinkedList
      -> PriorityQueue
