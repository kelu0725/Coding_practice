1. JDK vs JRE
JDK is the development kit that are used for developers, JDK includes JRE
JRE contains library, JVM implementation

2. Jar vs War
Jar is java achive, it is a complete java application
War is webapplication achive, 

3. Interface vs Abstract
Interface: a contract between clients and server, it has un implemented method that 
requires implementation whenever it is required.
Abstract class: in abstract class, abstract method and concrete. There are some subclasses that have same behaviors, 
we don't have to write the same method over again. 

4. serialization
to transfer objects from one machine to another machine. 

5. transient vs static
That variable cannot be serialized

6. checked exception/ unchecked exception
checked exception is compiled
all runtime exception is classified as unchecked exception

7. why we use exception

8. finally, final, finalized()

9. synchronized()
enable the lock explicitly, to work in multi-threading

10. Thread class interface implementing runnable interface, run()
which one is better to use?

11. autoboxing
use wrapper class, to primitive, autoboxing 

12. singleton design pattern, MVC controller



13. SOAP vs RESTFUL
Restful: http only; html, json; lightweight; test using simple url
SOAP

14. hibernate
servlet

15. servlet context object
web container object
data to shared on all objects

16. servlet config object

17. jsp

18. spring

19. spring modules, data acess, AOP, JSP

20. inject dependency
configure the bean, 
auto wiring process, by type, by name

21. main interface
application context
XML being 

22. BeanFactory vs Application Context
annotation, 



It can be packed into Jar file and run on any platform with JVM.
